# Virtual-Assistant-main
Iâ€™ve developed a Python-based AI Virtual Assistant using libraries like Pillow, lxml, requests-html, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, and PyAudio. It handles tasks such as greetings, telling time, playing music, opening websites, and providing weather updates. Excited to share my project!
